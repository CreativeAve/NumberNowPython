# NumberNowPython
Python 3 port of our app Number Now

This is an open-source reimplemntation of our Mac App Store app called Number Now.

What does it do?
Graphic designers frequently number documents - think invoices, tickets, etc. Any document that needs unique numbering. Long ago, this was done by dedicated machines, but with the switch to digital printing and data merges this task has fallen on designers. I worked at multiple offices where to create the required CSV files, designers would type 1,2,3 into a spreadsheet and drag their mouse cursor to autofill. It's not terrible if you need 25 or 50 numbers - but if you need 25,000 suddently that task takes a lot longer. 

Number Now simply takes input and generates that CSV file automatically. As a graphic designer in addition to a budding developer, I like to automate as many of my tasks as possible. For shops for with a scripted workflow, this code should also be able to be plugged in to existing automations.

Over the years, I've saved hours of my life using this to create my merged CSV files instead of doing it the long way. Hopefully some other designer without a better method can use this as well.

Cheers!
